Building DAG of jobs...
Using shell: /bin/bash
Provided cores: 1 (use --cores to define parallelism)
Rules claiming more threads will be scaled down.

rule get_NHM_data:
    output: out_CoastalCT_ext/GFv1.1.gdb
    jobid: 0
    resources: tmpdir=/tmp

Removing output files of failed job get_NHM_data since they might be corrupted:
out_CoastalCT_ext/GFv1.1.gdb
Skipped removing non-empty directory out_CoastalCT_ext/GFv1.1.gdb
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
